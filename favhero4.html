<p>Khan's father,<i> Mir Taj Mohammed Khan,</i>, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by <em>Abdul Ghaffar Khan</em> that sought a united and independent India. Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,and affiliated with the Indian National Congress. He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan. According to Khan his paternal grandfather,<i> Mir Jan Muhammad Khan</i>, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.
